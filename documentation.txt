An onClick handler was added to the edit and delete tags to allow for updating and deleting the todos

The onClick uses dispatch to fire the delete action. Also a
payload argument is provided which refers to any data needed for the reducer to perform
a given action (in this case, ‘delete’).

Next we add the 'delete' case to our reducer in app.js to handle the action

On  App, state.todos.filter checks for each element and filters for only todos whose id
is not equal to the todo’s id in the payload (the todo to be deleted). Note that
filter returns a whole new array for us. It does not change the existing array
and then return it.
